# Inputs

This folder has the code examples.

`quixbugs` folder contains the QuixBugs dataset version
<https://github.com/jkoppel/QuixBugs/commit/4257f44b0ff1181dedaedee6a447e133219fcebf>
with small modifications by us.
* Python programs have the final comment/documentation multiline strings removed.
  These strings are different between buggy and fixed versions but
  are irrelevant for the bugs themselves.
  Comments are also removed to simplify the text diffs.
